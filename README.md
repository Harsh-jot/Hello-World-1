# HacktoberFest2022

Hacktoberfest is the easiest way to get into open source!

This is a beginner-friendly project to help you get started with your hacktoberfest. If you don't know where to start, feel free to contact.

You can fork [this](https://github.com/tangytanya/Hello-World/fork) repository and add any of your Hello-World Programs by creating a directory and adding a README along with it.
